# Graph expanding using sampling (TIES)

This expanding algorithm uses TIES as the sampling algorithm.

**How to run**

Compile `main.py`. *Note: for now if you want to change the default expanding size (currently set as `3`), you also need to provide how many sampled graphs you want. This process will be later automated.*

## First results

**Dataset**

The following undirected Facebook graph from SNAP was used for the following results (edges from all egonets combined): https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html. This graph was expanded times `3`, with a fraction size of `0.6` for `5` sampled versions of the original graph.

The output (expanded) graph can be found in `graph_output/expanded_fb_graph_28-04-2017 04-47-51.csv`
